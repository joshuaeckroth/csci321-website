CSCI 321 - 01, Fall 2017 --- Software Development II

MWF 11-11:50am Eliz 205; pre-reqs: CSCI 221

This course prepares you to work on large software projects with a large team ("large" relative to typical undergraduate experiences). The entire course is centered around the project, and project milestones and presentations replace tests and homework.

Expected learning outcomes include experience in,

- working on a software project in a team
- developing and presenting a "pitch" presentation
- keeping track of project milestones and meeting deadlines
- keeping careful track of time (hours worked on the project each day)

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this class.

## Grading

Considering this is a project-oriented course, grading differs significantly from other courses. Much of your grade comes from bi-weekly performance reviews that I write for each individual student. These are described below. The rest of your grade comes from completing three project milestones (established after we decide on the project), presentations, and attendance.

Grading breakdown:

- 75% - weekly milestones
- 10% - pitch presentation (average of others' scores)
- 10% - final presentation
- 5% - daily attendance

The grading scale will follow the typical A = 93-100, A- = 90-92, B+ = 87-89, etc.

### Pitch presentation

In the first week of class, students will be paired into six groups of two. Each pair will be required to think of a whole-class project idea, develop a three-slide presentation, and present their idea for five minutes to the class. The pitch presentation slides must contain:

- slide 1: problem to be solved
- slide 2: how you propose to solve it
- slide 3: technologies involved, expertise required for each of 4 teams of 3 students

Every student watching the presentation (10 students) will evaluate the presentation according to seven grading metrics, 1-5 points each (5 is best):

  - presentation delivery (spoken)
  - presentation slides (visual)
  - overall clarity of presentation content
  - importance of problem
  - appropriateness of proposed solution and technology
  - feasibility of project for the class
  - your overall interest in working on this project

Thus, your score from each individual watching the presentation can range from 7-35 pts. Your grade will be the average of everyone's scores. Your partner will receive the same grade.

On Friday, Aug Sep 1, we will decide which project we will work on the rest of the semester. I will tell everyone the main contenders based on the pitch presentation scores.

### Final presentation

A final presentation will be scheduled during regular weekly class time so that other students and faculty may attend. All teams will be required to develop part of the presentation. Not all students are required to present; we'll figure out who will be presenting at a later date (presenting does not affect your grade).

During the final exam time, we will engage in a "retrospective" and discuss the project and successes and failures. Attendance is required (and attendance is graded) but there is no grade related to this retrospective discussion.

## Honor code

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University. In the context of this class, any code you use that is not authored by somebody in the class must be cited and that code's license must support our use (e.g., open source license).

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
